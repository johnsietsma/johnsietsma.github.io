![Kyle Walking]({{ site.assetsurl }}/images/arlighting/kyle_walking.gif))

Before ARCore and ARKit added environmental lighting, it was a real challenge to make AR content look like it was part of the real world.

I implemented a custom lighting solution in Unity that used the camera feed to add lighting and reflections to the virtual content. This really helped make content feel like it belonged.

Find the project on [Github](https://github.com/johnsietsma/ARCameraLighting).
