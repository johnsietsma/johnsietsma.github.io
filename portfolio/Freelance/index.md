An independent developer working on a number of freelance projects.

Some of those projects were:

- "Jewel Collector". Commissioned by Layar, I developed a game for the Mobile World Congress where Layar used this game to demonstrate their platform. If was one of the first location based Augmented Reality games. [First Layar Game Demoed at MWC](https://www.layar.com/news/blog/2010/02/14/first-layar-game-demod-at-mwc/)
- ["ACO Virtual Orchestra"](http://modprods.com/production/acovirtual/). A virtual orchestra experience for the Australian Chamber Orchestra.
- [QODE virtual conference](https://qodebrisbane.com/). [Visitor Vision](http://visitor.vision/) made a virtual exhibition due to COVID-19. I helped get this done on a very tight timeline by contributing to the virtual attendee AI.
