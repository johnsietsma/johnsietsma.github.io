As part of Unity's professional services I developed a virtual freeway project for [Main Roads Western Australia](https://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au).

Main Roads Western Australia use [Aimsun NEXT](https://www.aimsun.com/aimsun-next/) for traffic simulation when working freeway projects. Without a 3D simulation it can be difficult to visualize the impact of changes and to communicate changes to key stakeholders.

I developed a Unity integration for the traffic simulation software Aimsun NEXT using C#, sockets and Protocol Buffers. Using satellite imagery and road network data I created a virtual copy of a 20km length of highway. The software could produce fly through videos of the freeway changes that showed the vehicles from the traffic simulation driving under the new conditions.
