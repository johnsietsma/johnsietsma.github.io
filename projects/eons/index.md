Eons was a personal project to explore gaze interactions in Virtual Reality.

Two of the key interaction issues in VR are:

- Using any sort of controller is difficult while wearing a headset.
- Movement can cause motion sickness and can be hard to navigate.

So I reversed the idea of exploration and had the player bring things to them and interact with them, simply by looking.

Using gaze, players could:

- Pick up and examine objects.
- Scrub mirrors clean to see reflections.
- Change the appearance of objects to reveal space beyond.
- Open and close doors.
- Scroll pictures.
- Play audio.

This was enough for a player to explore a space naturally, even if they weren't used to 3D virtual spaces.

I used these mechanics to make a very simple locked room puzzle game.
