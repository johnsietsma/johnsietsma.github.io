The [QODE conference](https://qodebrisbane.com/) in Brisbane was in danger of being cancelled due to Covid-19. [Visitor Vision](http://visitor.vision/) stepped in to make a virtual exhibition space to help keep the conference going.

I helped get this done on a very tight timeline by contributing to the virtual attendee AI.
