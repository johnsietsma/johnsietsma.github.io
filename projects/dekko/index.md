Dekko developed augmented reality software which allows real and virtual objects to interact, without markers, on most surfaces.

My role was to take this technology and create demos and applications that demonstrated its strengths. I worked closely with an interface designer to work on some of the difficult interaction problems that come with Augmented Reality. To come up with new game designs that worked within the technical limitations and to implement them.

We published two demos to the app store, Dekko Monkey and Table Top Speed. Table Top Speed is still available for download.
