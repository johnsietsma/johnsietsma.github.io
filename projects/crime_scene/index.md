Virtual Crime Scene is a VR learning experience for Criminology students. Students analyse a crime scene; looking at evidence and identifying theories. They answer questions and look at a summary of events, ready to discuss in a lab after the experience.

I was the solo developer on this project (except for the email sending functionality), working with a designer/artist.
